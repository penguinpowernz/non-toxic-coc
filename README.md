# Non-Toxic Code of Conduct

Our community is built on the principles of meritocracy, where contributions are valued based on their quality, relevance, and impact. We strive to create an inclusive environment where individuals can collaborate, learn, and grow without the influence of personal biases, affiliations, or identities.

## Core Principles

1. **Merit-based contributions**: All contributions will be evaluated solely on their technical merit, without regard to the contributor's personal characteristics, affiliations, or identities.

1. **Neutral environment**: Our community space is a politics-free and identity-free zone. We discourage discussions or displays of personal affiliations, identities, or biases that may create a hostile or divisive environment.

1. **Respectful communication**: Members are expected to communicate respectfully and professionally, avoiding inflammatory language, personal attacks, or discriminatory behavior.

## Guidelines for Contributors

1. **Avoid self-identification**: Contributors are discouraged from displaying their personal affiliations, identities, or biases in their profile pictures, usernames, or signatures.  These include but are not limited to; sexual orientation or proclivities, gender identity, political affiliation or religion.

1. **Focused scrutiny**: Contributors who outwardly advertise their personal affiliations, identities, or biases may be subject to more focused scrutiny in non-technical conflicts, as their actions may be perceived as promoting a divisive or hostile environment.

1. **Toxic Behavior**: Assuming malicious intent, making unfounded accusations, or attempting to undermine the community's core values, core contributors, or this Code of Conduct will not be tolerated.

1. **Toxic Affiliation**: Affiliation with groups or individuals that promote or engage in toxic behaviour such as harassment, conspiracy against this community, conspiracy against this Code of Conduct or the conspiracy against the spirit of this Code of Conduct may result in removal.

## Consequences of Non-Compliance

Failure to adhere to this code of conduct may result in warnings, temporary or permanent bans, or other measures deemed necessary to maintain a neutral and respectful environment.
